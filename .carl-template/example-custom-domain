# Example Custom Domain
# =====================
# Copy this file to create your own domain.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Copy this file: cp example-custom-domain mydomain
#   2. Rename the rules: MYDOMAIN_RULE_0, MYDOMAIN_RULE_1, etc.
#   3. Add to manifest:
#        MYDOMAIN_STATE=active
#        MYDOMAIN_ALWAYS_ON=false
#        MYDOMAIN_RECALL=keyword1,keyword2,trigger phrase
#
# The domain will load when recall keywords are found in your prompt.
# Use ALWAYS_ON=true if you want it to load every prompt.
#
# Format: {DOMAIN}_RULE_{N}=rule text
# Rule numbers should be sequential starting from 0.

# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLE Domain Rules
# ============================================================================
EXAMPLE_RULE_0=This is Rule 0 - describe when these rules apply
EXAMPLE_RULE_1=This is Rule 1 - your first behavioral instruction
EXAMPLE_RULE_2=This is Rule 2 - another instruction Claude should follow
EXAMPLE_RULE_3=This is Rule 3 - add as many rules as needed
# EXAMPLE_RULE_4=Commented rules are ignored

# ============================================================================
# Tips for writing good rules:
# ============================================================================
# - Keep rules actionable and specific
# - Start with verbs: "Use...", "Check...", "Always...", "Never..."
# - Rule 0 often describes scope: when/why these rules apply
# - Use comments (#) for organization and notes
# - Test your domain by mentioning a recall keyword in your prompt
