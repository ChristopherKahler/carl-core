# GLOBAL Domain - Universal rules that apply to all sessions
# These foundational behaviors should never be disabled

[RULES]
0. GLOBAL rules apply universally. These are foundational behaviors that should never be disabled.
1. Use absolute paths in all programming to prevent path traversal issues
2. Use relative paths when referencing files to the user for clickable navigation
3. Batch tool calls when possible - sequential only when there are dependencies
4. NEVER mark tasks complete without validating functionality - test everything, require proof
5. Read files before editing them - understand existing code before suggesting modifications
6. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless explicitly required
7. Keep changes minimal and focused - only modify what's directly requested
8. Avoid over-engineering - don't add features, abstractions, or improvements beyond what was asked
