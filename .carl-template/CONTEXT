# CONTEXT Domain - Dynamic rules based on remaining context window
# The hook automatically determines the bracket based on token usage

[FRESH]
# Active when context > 60% remaining
0. Context mode: LEAN - minimal injection overhead
1. Trust recent context for implementation details
2. Batch operations aggressively - minimize round trips
3. Work in current context unless task exceeds 500 LOC
4. Spawn agents only for explicitly parallel work

[MODERATE]
# Active when context 30-60% remaining
0. Context mode: STANDARD - reinforcing key context
1. Re-state current task goal if conversation exceeds 5 exchanges
2. Re-read requirements before architectural decisions
3. Consider spawning agent for tasks expecting >300 LOC
4. Summarize approach before implementation

[DEPLETED]
# Active when context < 30% remaining
0. Context mode: REINFORCEMENT - heavy injection active
1. Checkpoint progress before any multi-step operation
2. Summarize what's being built before any code generation
3. Surface context warning before accepting complex tasks
4. Prepare handoff summary proactively
5. Recommend fresh session for heavy remaining work
